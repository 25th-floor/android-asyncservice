## Motivation

**Kiss** is born from an [article](http://blog.joanzapata.com/robust-architecture-for-an-android-app/) I wrote a few weeks ago, which gave me a lot of feedbacks and interesting comments. **Kiss** manages threading and caching transparently in your Android app. It's an alternative to [AsyncTasks](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html), [Loaders](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html), or more advanced libs like [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava), [Robospice](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice), [Groundy](https://github.com/telly/groundy),â€¦ but **Kiss** focuses on keeping your code short and simple! Its name means *keep it simple, stupid*, an old [design principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) invented in the 60s.

## Sample

**DemoService.java**
```java 
@KissService
public class DemoService {

    public User getUser(String name) {
        // Runs asynchronously.
        return ...;
    }

}
```

**DemoActivity.java**
```java
public class DemoActivity extends Activity {

    @InjectService 
    public DemoService service;

    @Override 
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
        Kiss.inject(this);
        
        // Returns nothing directly
        service.getUser("joan");
    }

    @OnMessage 
    public void onUser(User e) {
        // Runs on UI thread.
    }

}
```
